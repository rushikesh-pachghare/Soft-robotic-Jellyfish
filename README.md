# Soft-robotic-Jellyfish
Ongoing project on soft robotics
It is a hydraulically actuated soft robotic jellyfish which produces thrust by moving its tentacles. Ecoflex with shore A hardness 14 is used for the testing and prototype fabrication purpose. Three 12 volt mini DC pumps are used for the actuation purpose. Final fabrication and documentation is remaining due to the current situation of Covid-19.
